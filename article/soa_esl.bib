abstract = {Since re-designing and re-optimizing existing logic, memory, and IP$\backslash$nblocks in a 3D fashion significantly increases design cost, near-term$\backslash$nthree-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) design will focus on$\backslash$nreusing existing 2D blocks. One way to reuse 2D blocks in the 3D$\backslash$nIC design is to first perform 3D floorplanning, insert signal through-silicon$\backslash$nvias (TSVs) for 3D inter-block connections, and then route the blocks.$\backslash$nIn this paper, we propose algorithms (finding signal TSV locations,$\backslash$nassigning TSVs to whitespace blocks, and manipulating whitespace$\backslash$nblocks) for post-floorplanning signal TSV planning in the block-level$\backslash$n3D IC design. Experimental results show that our signal TSV planner$\backslash$noutperforms the state-of-the-art TSV-aware 3D floorplanner by 7{\%}$\backslash$nto 38{\%} with respect to wirelength. In addition, our multiple TSV$\backslash$ninsertion algorithm outperforms a single TSV insertion algorithm$\backslash$nby 27{\%} to 37{\%}.},
annote = {Do not talk about the partitioning problem, but rather about the dies bonding and TSV placement.
There is no mention of monolithic architecture, obviously, as there is no need for TSV in monolithic (only on substrate at the very bottom).},
