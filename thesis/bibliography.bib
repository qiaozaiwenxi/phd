abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 JSAP. 3D VLSI with a CoolCube™ integration allows vertically stacking several layers of devices with a unique connecting via density above a million/mm2. This results in increased density with no extra cost associated to transistor scaling, while benefiting from gains in power and performance thanks to wire-length reduction. CoolCube™ technology leads to high performance top transistors with Thermal Budgets (TB) compatible with bottom MOSFET integrity. Key enablers are the dopant activation by Solid Phase Epitaxy (SPE) or nanosecond laser anneal, low temperature epitaxy, low k spacers and direct bonding. New data on the maximal TB bottom MOSFET can withstand (with high temperatures but short durations) offer new opportunities for top MOSFET process optimization.},

abstract = {3-D integration technology is emerging as an attractive alternative to increase the transistor count for future chips. The majority of the existing 3-D integrated circuit (IC) research is focused on the performance, power, density, and heterogeneous integration benefits offered by 3-D integration. All such advantages, however, ultimately have to translate into cost evaluation when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, system-level cost analysis at early design stages is imperative to decide on whether 3-D integration should be adopted. This paper presents a cost estimation method for 3-D ICs at early design stages and proposes a set of cost models that include wafer cost, 3-D bonding cost, package cost, and cooling cost. The proposed 3-D IC cost estimation method can help designers analyze the cost implication for 3-D ICs during the design space exploration at the early stage, and it enables a cost-driven 3-D IC design flow that can guide the design choice toward a cost-effective direction. Based on the proposed cost estimation method, this paper demonstrates two case studies that explore the cost benefits of 3-D integration for application-specific integrated circuit designs and many-core microprocessor designs style, respectively. Finally, this paper suggests the optimum partitioning strategy for future 3-D IC designs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose two methods used in 3D IC placement that effectively exploit the die-to-die thermal coupling in the stack. First, TSVs are spread on each die to reduce the local power density and vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to increase thermal conductivity to the heatsink. Second, we move high-power logic cells to the location that has higher conductivity to the heatsink while moving TSVs in the upper dies so that high-power cells are vertically overlapping below the TSVs. These methods are em- ployed in a force-directed 3D placement successfully and outper- form several state-of-the-art placers published in recent literature.},

abstract = {Balanced graph partitioning in the streaming setting is a key problemto enable scalable and efficient computations on massive graph data such as web graphs, knowledge graphs, and graphs arising in the context of online social networks. Two families of heuristics for graph partitioning in the stream- ing setting are in wide use: place the newly arrived vertex in the cluster with the largest number of neighbors or in the cluster with the least number of non-neighbors. In this work, we introduce a framework which unifies the two seemingly orthogonal heuristics and allows us to quan- tify the interpolation between them. More generally, the framework enables a well principled design of scalable, stream- ing graph partitioning algorithms that are amenable to dis- tributed implementations. We derive a novel one-pass, stream- ing graph partitioning algorithm and show that it yields sig- nificant performance improvements over previous approaches using an extensive set of real-world and synthetic graphs. Surprisingly, despite the fact that our algorithm is a one- pass streaming algorithm, we found its performance to be in many cases comparable to the de-facto standard offline software METIS and in some cases even superiror. For in- stance, for the Twitter graph with more than 1.4 billion of edges, our method partitions the graph in about 40 minutes achieving a balanced partition that cuts as few as 6.8{\%} of edges, whereas it took more than 81 2 hours by METIS to produce a balanced partition that cuts 11.98{\%} of edges. We also demonstrate the performance gains by using our graph partitioner while solving standard PageRank computation in a graph processing platform with respect to the commu- nication cost and runtime.

Odin II's output can be fed into traditional back-end flows for both FPGAs and ASICs so that these improvements can be better quantified. Whereas the original Odin [1] provided an open source synthesis tool, Odin II's synthesis framework offers significant improvements such as a unified environment for both front-end parsing and netlist flattening. Odin II also interfaces directly with VPR [2], a common academic FPGA CAD flow, allowing an architectural description of a target FPGA as an input to enable identification and mapping of design features to custom features. Furthermore, Odin II can also read the netlists from downstream CAD stages into its netlist data-structure to facilitate analysis. Odin II can be used for a wide range of experiments; in this paper, we show three specific instances of how Odin II can be used by ASIC and FPGA researchers for more than basic synthesis. Odin II is open source and released under the MIT License.},

Today, we have Big Data, big graphs, big matrices, and in the future, they are expected to be bigger and more complex. Many of today's algorithms will be, and some already are, expensive to run on large datasets. In this work, we analyze a set of efficient techniques to make "big data", which is modeled as a hyper graph, smaller so that its processing takes much less time. As an application use case, we take the hyper graph partitioning problem, which has been successfully used in many practical applications for various purposes including parallelization of complex and irregular applications, sparse matrix ordering, clustering, community detection, query optimization, and improving cache locality in shared-memory systems. We conduct several experiments to show that our techniques greatly reduce the cost of the partitioning process and preserve the partitioning quality. Although we only measured their performance from the partitioning point of view, we believe the proposed techniques will be beneficial also for other applications using hyper graphs.},

The second phase uses a combination of greedy and local search heuristics to assemble the final partition. The algorithm performs especially well on road networks, which have an abundance of natural cuts (such as bridges, mountain passes, and ferries). In a few minutes, it obtains the best known partitions for continental-sized networks, significantly improving on previous results.},

We also explore the differences in thread lifetimes and data ownership in this context. We show that despite the options for fine-grain synchronization and task decomposition offered by current threading technologies, the best performance is achieved by preserving data ownership and minimizing synchronization. In addition to this we also present an unprotected approach to generating a vertex matching in parallel with little overhead. We use these findings to develop an OpenMP based implementation1 of the Metis algorithms and compare it against MPI based partitioners on three different multi-core architectures. Our multi-threaded implementation not only achieves greater than a factor of two speedup over the other partitioners, but also uses significantly less memory.},

abstract = {Graph partitioning is often used for load balancing in parallel computing, but it is known that hypergraph partitioning has several advantages. First, hypergraphs more accurately model communication volume, and second, they are more expressive and can better represent nonsymmetric problems. Hypergraph partitioning is particularly suited to parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication, a common kernel in scientific computing. We present a parallel software package for hypergraph (and sparse matrix) partitioning developed at Sandia National Labs. The algorithm is a variation on multilevel partitioning. Our parallel implementation is novel in that it uses a two-dimensional data distribution among processors. We present empirical results that show our parallel implementation achieves good speedup on several large problems (up to 33 million nonzeros) with up to 64 processors on a Linux cluster},

abstract = {The hypergraph partitioning problem has many applications in scientific computing and provides a more accurate inter-processor communication model for distributed systems than the equivalent graph problem. In this paper, we propose a sequential multi-level hypergraph partitioning algorithm. The algorithm makes novel use of the technique of rough set clustering in categorising the vertices of the hypergraph. The algorithm treats hyperedges as features of the hypergraph and tries to discard unimportant hyperedges to make better clustering decisions. It also focuses on the trade-off to be made between local vertex matching decisions (which have low cost in terms of the space required and time taken) and global decisions (which can be of better quality but have greater costs). The algorithm is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of benchmarks. The results show that it generates better partition quality.},

abstract = {Graph Theory has proved to be an extremely useful tool for solving combinatorial problems in such diverse areas as Geometry, Algebra, Number Theory, Topology, Operations Research and Optimization. It is natural to attempt to generalise the concept of a graph, in order to attack additional combinatorial problems. The idea of looking at a family of sets from this standpoint took shape around 1960. In regarding each set as a ``generalised edge'' and in calling the family itself a ``hypergraph'', the initial idea was to try to extend certain classical results of Graph Theory such as the theorems of Tur{\'{a}}n and K{\"{o}}nig. It was noticed that this generalisation often led to simplification; moreover, one single statement, sometimes remarkably simple, could unify several theorems on graphs. This book presents what seems to be the most significant work on hypergraphs.},

Effective clustering methods are an immediate by-product of the second eigenvector computation and are very successful on the difficult input classes proposed in the CAD literature. The intersection graph representation of the circuit netlist is considered, as a basis for partitioning, a heuristic based on spectral ratio cut partitioning of the netlist intersection graph is proposed.

As technology advances and design-styles change, physical design flows are constantly reinvented as traditional phases are removed and new ones are added to accommodate changes in technology. Handbook of Algorithms for Physical Design Automation provides a detailed overview of VLSI physical design automation, emphasizing state-of-the-art techniques, trends and improvements that have emerged during the previous decade. After a brief introduction to the modern physical design problem, basic algorithmic techniques, and partitioning, the book discusses significant advances in floorplanning representations and describes recent formulations of the floorplanning problem. The text also addresses issues of placement, net layout and optimization, routing multiple signal nets, manufacturability, physical synthesis, special nets, and designing for specialized technologies. It includes a personal perspective from Ralph Otten as he looks back on the major technical milestones in the history of physical design automation. Although several books on this topic are currently available, most are either too broad or out of date. Alternatively, proceedings and journal articles are valuable resources for researchers in this area, but the material is widely dispersed in the literature.

abstract = {This survey describes research directions in netlist partitioning during the past two decades in terms of both problem formulations and solution approaches. We discuss the traditional min-cut and ratio cut bipartitioning formulations along with multi-way extensions and newer problem formulations, e.g., constraint-driven partitioning (for FPGAs) and partitioning with module replication. Our discussion of solution approaches is divided into four major categories: move-based approaches, geometric representations, combinatorial formulations, and clustering approaches. Move-based algorithms iteratively explore the space of feasible solutions according to a neighborhood operator; such methods include greed, iterative exchange, simulated annealing, and evolutionary algorithms. Algorithms based on geometric representations embed the circuit netlist in some type of "geometry", e.g., a 1-dimensional linear ordering or a multi-dimensional vector space; the embeddings are commonly constructed using spectral methods. Combinatorial methods transform the partitioning problem into another type of optimization, e.g., based on network flows or mathematical programming. Finally, clustering algorithms merge the netlist modules into many small clusters; we discuss methods which combine clustering with existing algorithms (e.g., two-phase partitioning). The paper concludes with a discussion of benchmarking in the VLSI CAD partitioning literature and some perspectives on more promising directions for future work. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Billion-node graphs pose significant challenges at all levels from storage infrastructures to programming models. It is critical to de- velop a general purpose platform for graph processing. A distribut- ed memory system is considered a feasible platform supporting on- line query processing as well as offline graph analytics. In this paper, we study the problem of partitioning a billion-node graph on such a platform, an important consideration because it has direct impact on load balancing and communication overhead. It is chal- lenging not just because the graph is large, but because we can no longer assume that the data can be organized in arbitrary ways to maximize the performance of the partitioning algorithm. Instead, the algorithm must adopt the same data and programming model adopted by the system and other applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-level label propagation (MLP) method for graph partitioning. Experimental results show that our solution can parti- tion billion-node graphs within several hours on a distributed mem- ory system consisting of merely several machines, and the quality of the partitions produced by our approach is comparable to state- of-the-art approaches applied on toy-size graphs.},

We also present a commercial router-based monolithic intertier via insertion methodology that improves the routability of M3D ICs. We demonstrate that, unlike in 2D ICs, the routing supply and demand in M3D ICs are not completely independent of each other. We develop a routing demand model for M3D ICs, and use it to develop an O ( N ) min-overflow partitioner that enhances routability by off-loading demand from one tier to another. This technique reduces the routed wirelength and the power delay product by up to 7.44{\%} and 4.31{\%}, respectively. This allows a two-tier M3D IC to achieve, on average, 19.9{\%} and 11.8{\%} improvement in routed wirelength and power delay product over 2D, even with reduced metal layer usage.},

abstract = {We usually endow the investigated objects with pairwise relationships, which can be illustrated as graphs. In many real-world problems, however, relationships among the objects of our interest are more complex than pair- wise. Naively squeezing the complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be expected valuable for our learning tasks however. Therefore we consider using hypergraphs instead to completely represent complex relationships among the objects of our interest, and thus the problem of learning with hypergraphs arises. Our main contribution in this paper is to generalize the powerful methodology of spectral clustering which originally operates on undirected graphs to hy- pergraphs, and further develop algorithms for hypergraph embedding and transductive classification on the basis of the spectral hypergraph clustering approach. Our experiments on a number of benchmarks showed the advantages of hypergraphs over usual graphs.},

In particular, we describe for parallel coarsening, parallel greedy k-way refinement and parallel multi-phase refinement. Using an asymptotic theoretical performance model, we derive the isoefficiency function for our algorithms and hence show that they are technically scalable when the maximum vertex and hyperedge degrees are small. We conduct experiments on hypergraphs from six different application domains to investigate the empirical scalability of our algorithms both in terms of runtime and partition quality. Our findings confirm that the quality of partition produced by our algorithms is stable as the number of processors is increased while being competitive with those produced by a state-of-the-art serial multilevel partitioning tool. We also validate our theoretical performance model through an isoefficiency study. Finally, we evaluate the impact of introducing parallel multi-phase refinement into our parallel multilevel algorithm in terms of the trade off between improved partition quality and higher runtime cost. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We claim that hypergraph partitioning with multiple constraints and fixed vertices should be implemented using direct K-way refinement, instead of the widely adopted recursive bisection paradigm. Our arguments are based on the fact that recursive-bisection-based partitioning algorithms perform considerably worse when used in the multiple constraint and fixed vertex formulations. We discuss possible reasons for this performance degradation. We describe a careful implementation of a multi-level direct K-way hypergraph partitioning algorithm, which performs better than a well-known recursive-bisection-based partitioning algorithm in hypergraph partitioning with multiple constraints and fixed vertices.

An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V ???

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new hypergraph-partitioning algorithm that is based on the multilevel paradigm. In the multilevel paradigm, a sequence of successively coarser hypergraphs is constructed. A bisection of the smallest hypergraph is computed and it is used to obtain a bisection of the original hypergraph by successively projecting and refining the bisection to the next level finer hypergraph. We have developed new hypergraph coarsening strategies within the multilevel framework. We evaluate their performance both in terms of the size of the hyperedge cut on the bisection, as well as on the run time for a number of very large scale integration circuits. Our experiments show that our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm produces high-quality partitioning in a relatively small amount of time. The quality of the partitionings produced by our scheme are on the average 6{\%}-23{\%} better than those produced by other state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, our partitioning algorithm is significantly faster, often requiring 4-10 times less time than that required by the other schemes. Our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm scales very well for large hypergraphs. Hypergraphs with over 100 000 vertices can be bisected in a few minutes on today's workstations. Also, on the large hypergraphs, our scheme outperforms other schemes (in hyperedge cut) quite consistently with larger margins (9{\%}-30{\%}).},

This work helps to perform the optimization of the benchmark circuits with the above said components of physical design using hierarchical approach of evolutionary algorithms. The goal of minimizing the delay in partitioning; minimizing the silicon area in floorplanning; minimizing the layout area in placement; minimizing the wirelength in routing has indefinite influence on other criteria like power; clock; speed; cost; and so forth. Hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied on each of its phases to achieve the objective. Because evolutionary algorithm that includes one or many local search steps within its evolutionary cycles to obtain the minimization of area and interconnect length. This approach combines a hierarchical design like genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to attain the objective. This hybrid approach can quickly produce optimal solutions for the popular benchmarks.},

abstract = {Routing is an important and computationally intensive step in the VLSI physical design cycle. It is the process of interconnecting the cells that have been assigned positions as a solution of the placement problem. Global routing is a design action that precedes local routing and follows placement. Global routing decides about the distribution of the interconnections across the available routing channels. Then, all required connections can be established by solving the local routing problem in each channel separately. The combination of evolutionary algorithms with local search is named ldquoMemetic Algorithmsrdquo. These methods are inspired by models of natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of its members. In the context of heuristic optimization, a meme is taken to represent a learning or development strategy. Thus a memetic model of adaptation exhibits the plasticity of individuals that a strictly genetic model fails to capture. This paper deals with application of memetic algorithms to solve the problem of global routing. More particularly the emphasis is on the topics of wire length minimization and reduction of channel capacitances, and congestion estimation which are of utmost priority in any global routing scenario.},

@article{Barahona1988,
abstract = {We study the problem of finding ground states of spin glasses with exterior magnetic field, and the problem of minimizing the number of vias (holes on a printed circuit board, or contacts on a chip) subject to pin preassignments and layer preferences. The former problem comes up in solid-state physics, and the latter in very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) circuit design and in printed circuit board design. Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes.},

@article{Alpert1998,
abstract = { Multilevel partitioning approaches for circuit partitioning has been shown to be powerful (J. Cong and M. Smith, 1993; C.J. Alpert et al., 1996; 1997). We improve the excellent multilevel partitioning algorithm by C.J. Alpert et al. (1997) by taking edge frequency information (G. von Laszweski, 1993) into account during coarsening/uncoarsening, and to break ties. In addition, the uncoarsening phase is guided by an adaptive scheme which adds flexibility to the number of levels in the uncoarsening phase. We apply our algorithm to 13 benchmark circuits and achieve an improvement in min-cut and average min-cut values of up to 8.6{\%} and 34.6{\%} respectively, compared to the method by Alpert et al., at no extra runtime. Furthermore, our algorithm provides results of very stable quality. This positions our algorithm as current state of the art in multilevel circuit partitioning.},

abstract = {We illustrate how technical contributions in the VLSI CAD parti- tioning literature can fail to provide one or more of: (i) reproducible results and descriptions, (ii) an enabling account of the key under- standing or insight behind a given contribution, and (iii) experimen- tal evidence that is not only contrasted with the state-of-the-art, but also meaningful in light of the driving application. Such failings can lead to reporting of spurious and misguided conclusions. For example, new ideas may appear promising in the context of a weak experimental testbed, but in reality do not advance the state of the art. The resulting inefficiencies can be detrimental to the entire re- search community. We draw on several models (chiefly from the metaheuristics community) [5] for experimental research and re- porting in the area of heuristics for hard problems, and suggest that such practices can be adopted within the VLSI CAD community. Our focus is on hypergraph partitioning.},

This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program ans as an eigenvalue minimization problem. The best previously know approximation algorithms for these problems had performance gurantees of 1/2 for MAX CUT and 3/4 for MAX 2SAT. Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a 0.79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a 0.758-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem known approximation algorithms had performance guarantees of 1/4 and 3/4 respectively. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms.},

This problem is a natural generalization of several other problems such as minimum bisection, which is the (2,1)-balanced partitioning problem. We present a bicriteria polynomial time approximation algorithm with an O(log2n)-approximation for any constant $\upsilon$ {\textgreater} 1. For $\upsilon$ = 1 we show that no polytime approximation algorithm can guarantee a finite approximation ratio unless P=NP. Previous work has only considered the (k, $\upsilon$)-balanced partitioning problem for $\upsilon$ ≥ 2.},
