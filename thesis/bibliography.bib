abstract = {hMETIS is a set of programs for partitioning hypergraphs such as those corresponding to VLSI circuits. The algorithms implemented by hMETIS are based on the multilevel hypergraph partitioning schemes developed in our lab. The advantages of hMETIS are the following: Provides high quality partitions! On a wide range of hypergraphs arising in the VLSI domain hMETIS produces bisections that cut 10{\%} to 300{\%} fewer hyperedges than those cut by other popular algorithms such as PARABOLI, PROP, and CLIP-PROP, especially for circuits with over 100,000 cells, and circuits with non-unit cell area It is extremely fast! A single run of hMETIS is faster than a single run of simpler schemes such as FM, KL, or CLIP. Furthermore, because of its very good average cut characteristics, it produces high quality partitionings in significantly fewer runs. It can bisect circuits with over 100,000 vertices in a couple of minutes on Pentium-class workstations.},

@article{Ihler1993,
abstract = {An elegant and general way to apply graph partitioning algorithms to hypergraphs would be to model hypergraphs by graphs and apply the graph algorithms to these models. Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V âˆª D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed.},

@article{Hagen1992,
abstract = {Partitioning of circuit netlists in VLSI design is considered. It is shown that the second smallest eigenvalue of a matrix derived from the netlist gives a provably good approximation of the optimal ratio cut partition cost. It is also demonstrated that fast Lanczos-type methods for the sparse symmetric eigenvalue problem are a robust basis for computing heuristic ratio cuts based on the eigenvector of this second eigenvalue. Effective clustering methods are an immediate by-product of the second eigenvector computation and are very successful on the difficult input classes proposed in the CAD literature. The intersection graph representation of the circuit netlist is considered, as a basis for partitioning, a heuristic based on spectral ratio cut partitioning of the netlist intersection graph is proposed. The partitioning heuristics were tested on industry benchmark suites, and the results were good in terms of both solution quality and runtime. Several types of algorithmic speedups and directions for future work are discussed},

@article{Fiduccia1982,
abstract = {An iterative mincut heuristic for partitioning networks is presented whose worst case computation time, per pass, grows linearly with the size of the network. In practice, only a very small number of passes are typically needed, leading to a fast approximation algorithm for mincut partitioning. To deal with cells of various sizes, the algorithm progresses by moving one cell at a time between the blocks of the partition while maintaining a desired balance based on the size of the blocks rather than the number of cells per block. Efficient data structures are used to avoid unnecessary searching for the best cell to move and to minimize unnecessary updating of cells affected by each move.},

Finding the optimal ratio cut is NP-complete. However, in certain cases the ratio cut can be solved by linear programming techniques via the multicommodity flow problem. They also propose a fast heuristic algorithm running in linear time with respect to the number of pins in the circuit. Experiments show good results in all tested cases, and as much as 70{\%} improvement over the Kernighan-Lin algorithm in terms of the proposed ratio metric.},
