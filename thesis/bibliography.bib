@article{Karypis1998:hmetis,
abstract = {hMETIS is a set of programs for partitioning hypergraphs such as those corresponding to VLSI circuits. The algorithms implemented by hMETIS are based on the multilevel hypergraph partitioning schemes developed in our lab. The advantages of hMETIS are the following: Provides high quality partitions! On a wide range of hypergraphs arising in the VLSI domain hMETIS produces bisections that cut 10{\%} to 300{\%} fewer hyperedges than those cut by other popular algorithms such as PARABOLI, PROP, and CLIP-PROP, especially for circuits with over 100,000 cells, and circuits with non-unit cell area It is extremely fast! A single run of hMETIS is faster than a single run of simpler schemes such as FM, KL, or CLIP. Furthermore, because of its very good average cut characteristics, it produces high quality partitionings in significantly fewer runs. It can bisect circuits with over 100,000 vertices in a couple of minutes on Pentium-class workstations.},

@article{Ihler1993,
abstract = {An elegant and general way to apply graph partitioning algorithms to hypergraphs would be to model hypergraphs by graphs and apply the graph algorithms to these models. Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V âˆª D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed.},
