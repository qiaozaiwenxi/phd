abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 JSAP. 3D VLSI with a CoolCube™ integration allows vertically stacking several layers of devices with a unique connecting via density above a million/mm2. This results in increased density with no extra cost associated to transistor scaling, while benefiting from gains in power and performance thanks to wire-length reduction. CoolCube™ technology leads to high performance top transistors with Thermal Budgets (TB) compatible with bottom MOSFET integrity. Key enablers are the dopant activation by Solid Phase Epitaxy (SPE) or nanosecond laser anneal, low temperature epitaxy, low k spacers and direct bonding. New data on the maximal TB bottom MOSFET can withstand (with high temperatures but short durations) offer new opportunities for top MOSFET process optimization.},

abstract = {3-D integration technology is emerging as an attractive alternative to increase the transistor count for future chips. The majority of the existing 3-D integrated circuit (IC) research is focused on the performance, power, density, and heterogeneous integration benefits offered by 3-D integration. All such advantages, however, ultimately have to translate into cost evaluation when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, system-level cost analysis at early design stages is imperative to decide on whether 3-D integration should be adopted. This paper presents a cost estimation method for 3-D ICs at early design stages and proposes a set of cost models that include wafer cost, 3-D bonding cost, package cost, and cooling cost. The proposed 3-D IC cost estimation method can help designers analyze the cost implication for 3-D ICs during the design space exploration at the early stage, and it enables a cost-driven 3-D IC design flow that can guide the design choice toward a cost-effective direction. Based on the proposed cost estimation method, this paper demonstrates two case studies that explore the cost benefits of 3-D integration for application-specific integrated circuit designs and many-core microprocessor designs style, respectively. Finally, this paper suggests the optimum partitioning strategy for future 3-D IC designs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose two methods used in 3D IC placement that effectively exploit the die-to-die thermal coupling in the stack. First, TSVs are spread on each die to reduce the local power density and vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to increase thermal conductivity to the heatsink. Second, we move high-power logic cells to the location that has higher conductivity to the heatsink while moving TSVs in the upper dies so that high-power cells are vertically overlapping below the TSVs. These methods are em- ployed in a force-directed 3D placement successfully and outper- form several state-of-the-art placers published in recent literature.},

abstract = {Balanced graph partitioning in the streaming setting is a key problemto enable scalable and efficient computations on massive graph data such as web graphs, knowledge graphs, and graphs arising in the context of online social networks. Two families of heuristics for graph partitioning in the stream- ing setting are in wide use: place the newly arrived vertex in the cluster with the largest number of neighbors or in the cluster with the least number of non-neighbors. In this work, we introduce a framework which unifies the two seemingly orthogonal heuristics and allows us to quan- tify the interpolation between them. More generally, the framework enables a well principled design of scalable, stream- ing graph partitioning algorithms that are amenable to dis- tributed implementations. We derive a novel one-pass, stream- ing graph partitioning algorithm and show that it yields sig- nificant performance improvements over previous approaches using an extensive set of real-world and synthetic graphs. Surprisingly, despite the fact that our algorithm is a one- pass streaming algorithm, we found its performance to be in many cases comparable to the de-facto standard offline software METIS and in some cases even superiror. For in- stance, for the Twitter graph with more than 1.4 billion of edges, our method partitions the graph in about 40 minutes achieving a balanced partition that cuts as few as 6.8{\%} of edges, whereas it took more than 81 2 hours by METIS to produce a balanced partition that cuts 11.98{\%} of edges. We also demonstrate the performance gains by using our graph partitioner while solving standard PageRank computation in a graph processing platform with respect to the commu- nication cost and runtime.

abstract = {In this work, we present Odin II, a framework for Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) synthesis that allows researchers to investigate approaches/improvements to different phases of HDL elaboration that have not been previously possible. Odin II's output can be fed into traditional back-end flows for both FPGAs and ASICs so that these improvements can be better quantified. Whereas the original Odin [1] provided an open source synthesis tool, Odin II's synthesis framework offers significant improvements such as a unified environment for both front-end parsing and netlist flattening. Odin II also interfaces directly with VPR [2], a common academic FPGA CAD flow, allowing an architectural description of a target FPGA as an input to enable identification and mapping of design features to custom features. Furthermore, Odin II can also read the netlists from downstream CAD stages into its netlist data-structure to facilitate analysis. Odin II can be used for a wide range of experiments; in this paper, we show three specific instances of how Odin II can be used by ASIC and FPGA researchers for more than basic synthesis. Odin II is open source and released under the MIT License.},

Today, we have Big Data, big graphs, big matrices, and in the future, they are expected to be bigger and more complex. Many of today's algorithms will be, and some already are, expensive to run on large datasets. In this work, we analyze a set of efficient techniques to make "big data", which is modeled as a hyper graph, smaller so that its processing takes much less time. As an application use case, we take the hyper graph partitioning problem, which has been successfully used in many practical applications for various purposes including parallelization of complex and irregular applications, sparse matrix ordering, clustering, community detection, query optimization, and improving cache locality in shared-memory systems. We conduct several experiments to show that our techniques greatly reduce the cost of the partitioning process and preserve the partitioning quality. Although we only measured their performance from the partitioning point of view, we believe the proposed techniques will be beneficial also for other applications using hyper graphs.},

The second phase uses a combination of greedy and local search heuristics to assemble the final partition. The algorithm performs especially well on road networks, which have an abundance of natural cuts (such as bridges, mountain passes, and ferries). In a few minutes, it obtains the best known partitions for continental-sized networks, significantly improving on previous results.},

We also explore the differences in thread lifetimes and data ownership in this context. We show that despite the options for fine-grain synchronization and task decomposition offered by current threading technologies, the best performance is achieved by preserving data ownership and minimizing synchronization. In addition to this we also present an unprotected approach to generating a vertex matching in parallel with little overhead. We use these findings to develop an OpenMP based implementation1 of the Metis algorithms and compare it against MPI based partitioners on three different multi-core architectures. Our multi-threaded implementation not only achieves greater than a factor of two speedup over the other partitioners, but also uses significantly less memory.},

abstract = {Graph partitioning is often used for load balancing in parallel computing, but it is known that hypergraph partitioning has several advantages. First, hypergraphs more accurately model communication volume, and second, they are more expressive and can better represent nonsymmetric problems. Hypergraph partitioning is particularly suited to parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication, a common kernel in scientific computing. We present a parallel software package for hypergraph (and sparse matrix) partitioning developed at Sandia National Labs. The algorithm is a variation on multilevel partitioning. Our parallel implementation is novel in that it uses a two-dimensional data distribution among processors. We present empirical results that show our parallel implementation achieves good speedup on several large problems (up to 33 million nonzeros) with up to 64 processors on a Linux cluster},

abstract = {The hypergraph partitioning problem has many applications in scientific computing and provides a more accurate inter-processor communication model for distributed systems than the equivalent graph problem. In this paper, we propose a sequential multi-level hypergraph partitioning algorithm. The algorithm makes novel use of the technique of rough set clustering in categorising the vertices of the hypergraph. The algorithm treats hyperedges as features of the hypergraph and tries to discard unimportant hyperedges to make better clustering decisions. It also focuses on the trade-off to be made between local vertex matching decisions (which have low cost in terms of the space required and time taken) and global decisions (which can be of better quality but have greater costs). The algorithm is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of benchmarks. The results show that it generates better partition quality.},

abstract = {Graph Theory has proved to be an extremely useful tool for solving combinatorial problems in such diverse areas as Geometry, Algebra, Number Theory, Topology, Operations Research and Optimization. It is natural to attempt to generalise the concept of a graph, in order to attack additional combinatorial problems. The idea of looking at a family of sets from this standpoint took shape around 1960. In regarding each set as a ``generalised edge'' and in calling the family itself a ``hypergraph'', the initial idea was to try to extend certain classical results of Graph Theory such as the theorems of Tur{\'{a}}n and K{\"{o}}nig. It was noticed that this generalisation often led to simplification; moreover, one single statement, sometimes remarkably simple, could unify several theorems on graphs. This book presents what seems to be the most significant work on hypergraphs.},

Effective clustering methods are an immediate by-product of the second eigenvector computation and are very successful on the difficult input classes proposed in the CAD literature. The intersection graph representation of the circuit netlist is considered, as a basis for partitioning, a heuristic based on spectral ratio cut partitioning of the netlist intersection graph is proposed.

Handbook of Algorithms for Physical Design Automation provides a detailed overview of VLSI physical design automation, emphasizing state-of-the-art techniques, trends and improvements that have emerged during the previous decade. After a brief introduction to the modern physical design problem, basic algorithmic techniques, and partitioning, the book discusses significant advances in floorplanning representations and describes recent formulations of the floorplanning problem. The text also addresses issues of placement, net layout and optimization, routing multiple signal nets, manufacturability, physical synthesis, special nets, and designing for specialized technologies. It includes a personal perspective from Ralph Otten as he looks back on the major technical milestones in the history of physical design automation. Although several books on this topic are currently available, most are either too broad or out of date. Alternatively, proceedings and journal articles are valuable resources for researchers in this area, but the material is widely dispersed in the literature.

abstract = {This survey describes research directions in netlist partitioning during the past two decades in terms of both problem formulations and solution approaches. We discuss the traditional min-cut and ratio cut bipartitioning formulations along with multi-way extensions and newer problem formulations, e.g., constraint-driven partitioning (for FPGAs) and partitioning with module replication. Our discussion of solution approaches is divided into four major categories: move-based approaches, geometric representations, combinatorial formulations, and clustering approaches. Move-based algorithms iteratively explore the space of feasible solutions according to a neighborhood operator; such methods include greed, iterative exchange, simulated annealing, and evolutionary algorithms. Algorithms based on geometric representations embed the circuit netlist in some type of "geometry", e.g., a 1-dimensional linear ordering or a multi-dimensional vector space; the embeddings are commonly constructed using spectral methods. Combinatorial methods transform the partitioning problem into another type of optimization, e.g., based on network flows or mathematical programming. Finally, clustering algorithms merge the netlist modules into many small clusters; we discuss methods which combine clustering with existing algorithms (e.g., two-phase partitioning). The paper concludes with a discussion of benchmarking in the VLSI CAD partitioning literature and some perspectives on more promising directions for future work. ?? 1995.},

It is critical to de- velop a general purpose platform for graph processing. A distribut- ed memory system is considered a feasible platform supporting on- line query processing as well as offline graph analytics. In this paper, we study the problem of partitioning a billion-node graph on such a platform, an important consideration because it has direct impact on load balancing and communication overhead. It is chal- lenging not just because the graph is large, but because we can no longer assume that the data can be organized in arbitrary ways to maximize the performance of the partitioning algorithm. Instead, the algorithm must adopt the same data and programming model adopted by the system and other applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-level label propagation (MLP) method for graph partitioning. Experimental results show that our solution can parti- tion billion-node graphs within several hours on a distributed mem- ory system consisting of merely several machines, and the quality of the partitions produced by our approach is comparable to state- of-the-art approaches applied on toy-size graphs.},

We also present a commercial router-based monolithic intertier via insertion methodology that improves the routability of M3D ICs. We demonstrate that, unlike in 2D ICs, the routing supply and demand in M3D ICs are not completely independent of each other. We develop a routing demand model for M3D ICs, and use it to develop an O ( N ) min-overflow partitioner that enhances routability by off-loading demand from one tier to another. This technique reduces the routed wirelength and the power delay product by up to 7.44{\%} and 4.31{\%}, respectively. This allows a two-tier M3D IC to achieve, on average, 19.9{\%} and 11.8{\%} improvement in routed wirelength and power delay product over 2D, even with reduced metal layer usage.},

abstract = {We usually endow the investigated objects with pairwise relationships, which can be illustrated as graphs. In many real-world problems, however, relationships among the objects of our interest are more complex than pair- wise. Naively squeezing the complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be expected valuable for our learning tasks however. Therefore we consider using hypergraphs instead to completely represent complex relationships among the objects of our interest, and thus the problem of learning with hypergraphs arises. Our main contribution in this paper is to generalize the powerful methodology of spectral clustering which originally operates on undirected graphs to hy- pergraphs, and further develop algorithms for hypergraph embedding and transductive classification on the basis of the spectral hypergraph clustering approach. Our experiments on a number of benchmarks showed the advantages of hypergraphs over usual graphs.},

In particular, we describe for parallel coarsening, parallel greedy k-way refinement and parallel multi-phase refinement. Using an asymptotic theoretical performance model, we derive the isoefficiency function for our algorithms and hence show that they are technically scalable when the maximum vertex and hyperedge degrees are small. We conduct experiments on hypergraphs from six different application domains to investigate the empirical scalability of our algorithms both in terms of runtime and partition quality. Our findings confirm that the quality of partition produced by our algorithms is stable as the number of processors is increased while being competitive with those produced by a state-of-the-art serial multilevel partitioning tool. We also validate our theoretical performance model through an isoefficiency study. Finally, we evaluate the impact of introducing parallel multi-phase refinement into our parallel multilevel algorithm in terms of the trade off between improved partition quality and higher runtime cost. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We claim that hypergraph partitioning with multiple constraints and fixed vertices should be implemented using direct K-way refinement, instead of the widely adopted recursive bisection paradigm. Our arguments are based on the fact that recursive-bisection-based partitioning algorithms perform considerably worse when used in the multiple constraint and fixed vertex formulations. We discuss possible reasons for this performance degradation. We describe a careful implementation of a multi-level direct K-way hypergraph partitioning algorithm, which performs better than a well-known recursive-bisection-based partitioning algorithm in hypergraph partitioning with multiple constraints and fixed vertices.

Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V ??? D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed. ?? 1983.},

A single run of hMETIS is faster than a single run of simpler schemes such as FM, KL, or CLIP.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new hypergraph-partitioning algorithm that is based on the multilevel paradigm. In the multilevel paradigm, a sequence of successively coarser hypergraphs is constructed. A bisection of the smallest hypergraph is computed and it is used to obtain a bisection of the original hypergraph by successively projecting and refining the bisection to the next level finer hypergraph. We have developed new hypergraph coarsening strategies within the multilevel framework. We evaluate their performance both in terms of the size of the hyperedge cut on the bisection, as well as on the run time for a number of very large scale integration circuits. Our experiments show that our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm produces high-quality partitioning in a relatively small amount of time. The quality of the partitionings produced by our scheme are on the average 6{\%}-23{\%} better than those produced by other state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, our partitioning algorithm is significantly faster, often requiring 4-10 times less time than that required by the other schemes. Our multilevel hypergraph-partitioning algorithm scales very well for large hypergraphs. Hypergraphs with over 100 000 vertices can be bisected in a few minutes on today's workstations. Also, on the large hypergraphs, our scheme outperforms other schemes (in hyperedge cut) quite consistently with larger margins (9{\%}-30{\%}).},

abstract = {Routing is an important and computationally intensive step in the VLSI physical design cycle. It is the process of interconnecting the cells that have been assigned positions as a solution of the placement problem. Global routing is a design action that precedes local routing and follows placement. Global routing decides about the distribution of the interconnections across the available routing channels. Then, all required connections can be established by solving the local routing problem in each channel separately. The combination of evolutionary algorithms with local search is named ldquoMemetic Algorithmsrdquo. These methods are inspired by models of natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of its members. In the context of heuristic optimization, a meme is taken to represent a learning or development strategy. Thus a memetic model of adaptation exhibits the plasticity of individuals that a strictly genetic model fails to capture. This paper deals with application of memetic algorithms to solve the problem of global routing. More particularly the emphasis is on the topics of wire length minimization and reduction of channel capacitances, and congestion estimation which are of utmost priority in any global routing scenario.},

Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes.},

abstract = { Multilevel partitioning approaches for circuit partitioning has been shown to be powerful (J. Cong and M. Smith, 1993; C.J. Alpert et al., 1996; 1997). We improve the excellent multilevel partitioning algorithm by C.J. Alpert et al. (1997) by taking edge frequency information (G. von Laszweski, 1993) into account during coarsening/uncoarsening, and to break ties. In addition, the uncoarsening phase is guided by an adaptive scheme which adds flexibility to the number of levels in the uncoarsening phase. We apply our algorithm to 13 benchmark circuits and achieve an improvement in min-cut and average min-cut values of up to 8.6{\%} and 34.6{\%} respectively, compared to the method by Alpert et al., at no extra runtime. Furthermore, our algorithm provides results of very stable quality. This positions our algorithm as current state of the art in multilevel circuit partitioning.},

Such failings can lead to reporting of spurious and misguided conclusions. For example, new ideas may appear promising in the context of a weak experimental testbed, but in reality do not advance the state of the art. The resulting inefficiencies can be detrimental to the entire re- search community. We draw on several models (chiefly from the metaheuristics community) [5] for experimental research and re- porting in the area of heuristics for hard problems, and suggest that such practices can be adopted within the VLSI CAD community.

Of course such models have to simulate the given hypergraphs with respect to their cut properties. An edge-weighted graph (V, E) is a cut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the edges cut by any bipartition of V in the graph is the same as the weight of the hyperedges cut by the same bipartition in the hypergraph. We show that there is no cut-model in general. Next we examine whether the addition of dummy vertices helps: An edge-weighted graph (V ∪ D, E) is a mincut-model for an edge-weighted hypergraph (V, H) if the weight of the hyperedges cut by a bipartition of the hypergraphs vertices is the same as the weight of a minimum cut separating the two parts in the graph. We construct such models using positive and negative weights. On the other hand, we show that there is no mincut-model in general if only positive weights are allowed.},

abstract = {Multilevel strategies have proven to be very powerful approaches in order to partition graphs efficiently. Their efficiency is dominated by two parts; the coarsening and the local improvement strategies. Several methods have been developed to solve these problems, but their efficiency has only been proven on an experimental basis. In this paper, we present new and efficient methods for both problems, while satisfying certain quality measurements. For the coarsening part we develop a new approximation algorithm for maximum weighted matching in general edge-weighted graphs. It calculates a matching with an edge weight of at least 12 of the edge weight of a maximum weighted matching. Its time complexity is O(|E|), with |E| being the number of edges in the graph. Furthermore, we use the Helpful-Set strategy for the local improvement of partitions. For partitioning graphs with a regular degree of 2k into two parts, it guarantees an upper bound of ((k−1)/2)|V|+1 on the cut size of the partition, with |V| being the number of vertices. These quality methods used for the two parts of the multilevel approach lead to an efficient graph-partitioning concept.},

Quality improvements compared to previous systems are due to better prioritization of edges to be contracted, better approximation algorithms for identifying matchings, better local search heuristics, and perhaps most notably, a parallelization of the FM local search algorithm that works more locally than previous approaches.},

@inproceedings{Dutt1993,
abstract = {In this paper we present a very efficient graph partitioning scheme QuickCut that uses the basic strategy of the Kernighan-Lin (K-L) algorithm to swap pairs of nodes to improve an existing partition of a graph G. The main feature of QuickCut is a "neighborhood search" strategy that is based on the result (obtained in this paper) that it is not necessary to search more than a certain subset of d/sup 2/ node pairs to find the node pair with the maximum swap gain. Here d is the maximum node degree of G. We also use an improved data structure, viz., balanced trees, to store the nodes in the two partitions. Due to the new search strategy and data structure, QuickCut has a worst-case time complexity of /spl Theta/(max(ed, e log n)), and an average-case complexity of /spl Theta/(e log n), where e is the number of edges of G. The K-L algorithm, on the other hand, has a time complexity of /spl Theta/(n/sup 2/ log n), where n is the number of nodes of G. Another contribution of this paper is the presentation of efficient node-pair scanning methods for obtaining the best node pair to swap in the K-L algorithm. We have implemented QuickCut, K-L, and its various enhancements suggested here. The results obtained from using these different algorithms to partition a number of random and other well-defined graphs show that QuickCut is the fastest, and that it is faster than the K-L algorithm by factors of 5 to 50. Thus QuickCut can serve as the basis for very fast VLSI partitioning and layout tools.},

abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers have investigated a class of algorithms that are based on multilevel graph partitioning that have moderate computational complexity, and provide excellent graph partitions. However, there exists little theoretical analysis that could explain the ability of multilevel algorithms to produce good partitions. In this paper we present such an analysis. We show under certain reasonable assumptions that even if no refinement is used in the uncoarsening phase, a good bisection of the coarser graph is worse than a good bisection of the finer graph by at most a small factor. We also show that the size of a good vertex-separator of the coarse graph projected to the finer graph (without performing refinement in the uncoarsening phase) is higher than the size of a good vertex-separator of the finer graph by at most a small factor.},

In this paper we show that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First we show the completeness of Simple Max Cut (Max Cut with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the Optimal Linear Arrangement problem. We then show that even if the domains of the Node Cover and Directed Hamiltonian Path problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For Graph 3-Colorability, Node Cover, and Undirected Hamiltonian Circuit, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete. ?? 1976.},

In general, there is a case where a practical performance of a conventional genetic approach, which performs only simple operations without a local search strategy, is not sufficient. However, it is known that a combination of GA and local search can produce better solutions. From this practice, we incorporate a simple local search algorithm into the GA. In particular, the search ability of the GA is compared with standard heuristics such as multistart local search and simulated annealing, which use the same neighborhood structure of the simple local search, for solving the GPP. Experimental results show that the GA performs better than its competitors.},

abstract = {3DICs with multiple tiers are expected to achieve large benefits (e.g., in terms of power, area) as compared to conventional planar designs. However, few if any previous works study upper bounds on power and area benefits from 3DIC integration with multiple tiers. In this work, we use the concept of implementation with infinite dimension to estimate upper bounds on power and area benefits achievable by 3DICs versus 2DICs. We observe that the maximum power benefit even with infinite dimension can be only 18{\%} versus 2DIC for particular designs. Such benefits reduce further under assumptions of inter-tier variation. We confirm our observation by performing 3D benefit estimation across various technologies. Our study also indicates that it is typically difficult for pure logic-logic 3D integration to achieve a simultaneous (10{\%}, 10{\%}, 10{\%}) improvement in (performance, power, area/cost) compared to the conventional 2D implementation. In addition, we study power of designs across various dimensions (e.g., pseudo-1D, 2D, 3D with two, three and four tiers).1 We observe that design power sensitivity to implementation with different dimensions correlates well with placement-based Rent parameter of the netlist. Therefore, placement-based Rent parameter can possibly be a simple indicator of 3D power benefit. Our study also shows that netlist synthesis and optimization should be aware of the target implementation dimension (e.g., 2D versus 3D). Finally, we use a simple example to show that there remain potential large 3DIC benefits versus 2DIC for (block-based) SoC designs.},

Our contributions include, (1) a new 3D floorplan representation, CBA and new interlayer local operations to more efficiently exploit the solution space; (2) an efficient thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm with an integrated compact resistive network thermal model (CBA-T); (3) two fast thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithms using two different thermal models with different runtime and quality (CBA-T-Fast and CBA-T-Hybrid). Our experiments show that the proposed 3D floorplan algorithm with CBA representation can reduce the wirelength by 29{\%} compared with a recent published result from [19]. In addition, compared to a non-thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm, the thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm can reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 56{\%}.},

abstract = {The advancement of contemporary three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) technologies offers a promising solution for the insatiable demand of the consumer electronics market. The increased complexity of 3D IC design permits the execution of multiple applications at greater speeds whilst remaining within the design constraints of energy consumption, yield and time-to-market. However, the increased computing performance and compact size may introduce a thermal barrier inhibiting performance, particularly in the case where multiple logic die are stacked and co-aligned hotspots are induced. To mitigate this thermal barrier a novel integrated active thermal solution is investigated in this paper whose purpose is to alleviate hotspots in a contemporary two-die 3D IC architecture. The solution employs a series of integrated microchannels, which permits the transfer of heat, via a coolant, from lower to upper strata. This microfluidic system is driven by a series of integrated AC electrokinetic pumps embedded in the channel walls. Recent advancements in electrokinetic micropump technology have allowed greater increases in fluid velocity - to an order of mm/s - while operating within the voltage constraints of a 3D IC. Numerically qualitative and quantitative temperature distributions are presented for a 3D IC chip design both with and without microchannels for a constant heat flux on the active layer of each silicon chip. The implementation of a microchannel network is shown to alter the thermal distribution map within a 3D IC package creating hot and cold zones with variations on temperature of -14.6 °C≤$\Delta$T≤9.8 °C with a $\Delta$T max of -6.5 °C in the silicon die stack (equivalent to a total maximum heat flux, q max″, of approximately 112.5 W/cm 2). Increasing bulk fluid velocity, within the range 1.3 mm/s≤u avg≤13 mm/s, can vary the area of the cold zone enhancing heat transfer and reducing the temperature of the die stack without an overall temperature change in the package. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, a strong need of a physics-based simulation methodology emerges. This physics-based simulation, however, requires material parameters with high accuracy. A full-chip analysis can then be performed, balancing the need for local resolution and computing time. The key for an efficient simulation of a 3D stacked IC is a comprehensive database with material properties for multiple scales of the affected materials. Therefore, effective "composite-type" material data for several regions of interest are needed. Advanced techniques to measure FEA- and design-relevant properties such as adhesion properties and effective CTE values are presented.},

abstract = {3D integrated circuits (3-D ICs) technology is a promising approach for next-generation semiconductor microelectronics. A 3D IC is formed by vertical interconnection of multiple substrates containing active devices which offer reduced die footprint and interconnect length. Thermal management of a multi die stack is a significant research challenge, for which rapid temperature computation in a 3D IC is desirable. This manuscript presents a non-iterative heat transfer model for predicting the three-dimensional temperature field in a multi-die 3D IC. The non-iterative model is much faster and accurate in comparison to finite element simulation and recently presented iterative models for temperature computation. The analytical model is used to compute the temperature field of a 3D IC with a large number of die. The model is also used to examine the effect of various parameters on the computed temperature field. In particular, the effect of thermal contact resistance is presented. The model and results presented in this manuscript are expected be useful in rapid computation and effective thermal design of 3D ICs.},

First, a multicore ×86 compatible cycle-level microarchitecture simulator was constructed and integrated with physical power models. The simulator executes benchmark programs to create power traces that drive thermal analysis. Second, the thermal characteristics under liquid cooling were investigated using a compact thermal model. Four alternative packaging organizations were studied and compared. The greatest overall temperature reduction under a given pumping power is achieved, with two tiers and two pin fin enhanced microgaps, with the high power dissipation tier on the top. Third, an optimization of the pin fin parameters including the diameter, height, and longitudinal and transversal spacing was performed. This optimization is shown to achieve significant improvement in energy/instruction, and significant reductions in leakage power.},

The improvement is achieved due to the reduction of wire length, which results in decreased interconnection delay.

This problem can be mitigated through appropriate floorplanning. For this reason, in this work we present and compare five different solutions for floorplanning of 3D chips. Each solution uses a different representation, and all are based on meta-heuristic algorithms, namely three of them are based on simulated annealing, while two other are based on evolutionary algorithms.

This paper analyzes IC cooling while focusing on the practical temperature range of operation. Comprehensive analyses of chip cooling for various nanometer scale bulk-CMOS and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies are presented. Unlike all previous works, this analysis employs a holistic approach (combines device, circuit and system level considerations) and also takes various electrothermal couplings between power dissipation, operating frequency and die temperature into account. While chip cooling always gives performance gain at the device and circuit level, it is shown that system level power defines a temperature limit beyond which cooling gives diminishing returns and an associated cost that may be prohibitive. A scaling analysis of this temperature limit is also presented. Furthermore, it is shown that on-chip thermal gradients cannot be mitigated by global chip cooling and that localized cooling can be more effective in removing hot-spots.},

abstract = {Thermal analysis is essential in 3D-IC technology due to the reduced footprint and higher power densities compared to conventional 2D packaging. Computationally fast thermal models (FTMs) are being developed for fast evaluation of the temperature distribution in 3D packages. The steady state FTM discussed in this paper is based on Green??s function theory and exploits convolution and the fast Fourier transform to compute the temperature profiles starting from matrices storing the power dissipation densities (power maps) and the temperature responses to hot spots. However, this methodology is not directly applicable for finite dimensional structures. The method of images is exploited to include the effect of insulating lateral boundary conditions. The number of images needed to ensure accurate results depends on the specific structure of the stack. A fast method to compute it is proposed together with a short analysis of its dependence on some system parameters. A two dies stack case study is thermally analyzed showing good agreement with the finite element method (FEM) results (errors less than 0.5{\%}). The computational time is also discussed indicating a O(NlogN) behavior, where N is the number of elements in the extended power maps, which include images, as well as a 70 times speed up with respect to FEM. Finally, since in the FTM the package is implicitly included in the boundary conditions, the thermal impact of its real configuration is investigated.},

abstract = {Non-uniformity in thermal profiles of integrated circuits (ICs) is an issue that threatens their performance and reliability. This paper investigates the correlation between the total power consumption and the temperature variations across a chip. As a result, floorplanning guidelines are proposed that uses the correlation to efficiently optimize the chip's total power and takes into account the thermal uniformity. It is demonstrated that optimizing a floorplan to minimize either the leakage or the peak temperature can lead to a significant increase in the total power consumption. In this paper, the experimental results show that lowering the temperature variations across a chip not only addresses performance degradation and reliability concerns, but also significantly contributes to chip power reduction. In addition, it is found that although uniformity in the thermal profile can be very effective in lowering the total power consumption, the most uniform temperature distribution does not necessarily correspond to the highest power savings. Consequently, for some applications, a 2{\%} deviation from the minimum total power is traded for up to a 25{\%} increase in thermal uniformity.

abstract = {Designing power-efficient Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) for 3D ICs has emerged as a promising solution for complex mobile and portable applications. The total power consumption of a 3D NoC design depends on the allocation of the Intellectual properties (IPs) to the different network routers and the number of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) used in the design. In this paper, we introduce a new analytical model for the power consumption of 3D NoCs. This new model relies on graph-theoretic concepts and incorporates static and dynamic power in order to present a more accurate evaluation of 3D NoC power consumption. The proposed model utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path routing. It also reflects the impact of using TSVs in 3D ICs. Using the proposed model, we develop a new methodology to select the 3D NoC topology and find the best IP-mapping. The proposed methodology utilizes a bio-inspired optimization technique. We compare particle swarm optimization (PSO) to genetic algorithms (GAs) in order to find the best 3D mesh network mapping that achieves minimum power consumption. The presented methodology is validated through two case studies to address symmetric and asymmetric multicore applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many-tier systems are the future of 3D integration. In this work we explore power delivery system design for these large scale devices. We have developed a scalable many-tier design that contains one tier of processors and eight tiers of DRAM. These nine tiers comprise a 'set' that can be stacked any number of times. Previously, we have examined the dynamic and static power noise scaling behavior of various components of this system. Now, we present studies on two key aspects of power system architecture in these systems and their impact on power supply noise. First, we examine the addition of a dynamic noise-limiting turn-on policy and show that it can reduce dynamic power supply noise by 37{\%} with almost no impact on system performance. Next, we present interesting results comparing different power/ground TSV topologies and show that a spread TSV distribution can lower both DC and dynamic power supply noise in the case that the many-tier stack contains low power tiers, such as memory tiers. We also show that ignoring TSV inductance when calculating dynamic noise can result in a 14.8{\%} underestimate.},

abstract = {At the moment, a major paradigm change, from 2D IC to 3D IC, is occurring in microelectronic industry. Joule heating is serious in 3D IC, and vertical interconnect is the critical element to be developed. Also reliability concerns will be extremely important. For example, in order to remove heat, a temperature gradient must exist in the packaging. If we assume just a difference of 1 °C across a micro-bump of 10 $\mu$m in diameter, the temperature gradient is 1000 °C/cm which cannot be ignored due to thermomigration. Equally challenging reliability issues are electromigration and stress-migration. Since the 3D IC structure is new, the details of reliability problems are mostly unknown. This paper presents a projection of the reliability challenges in 3D IC packaging technology on the basis of what we have known from flip chip technology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Through-silicon via (TSV) and bonding technologies are the key technologies of 3D IC, and the corresponding reliability has to be well evaluated and qualified before real production applications. This paper reviews the emerging 3D interconnection technologies in worldwide 3D integration platforms with the latest reliability assessment results, including the reliability demonstration of Cu and oxide hybrid bonding in Ziptronix's platform, micro-bump and adhesive hybrid bonding in ITRI's platform, adhesive bonding followed by TSV formation in WOW alliance's platform, wide I/O interface TSV interposer in Xilinx's platform, and the active and passive TSV interposer in Samsung, TSMC and ASE's platforms. With low temperature bonding and TSV processes, optimized design and material selection to lower the induced stress and warpage, these platforms are successfully developed with enhanced reliability.

First part presents an exhaustive analysis of Cu TSV-last approach of 2 $\mu$m diameter and 15 $\mu$m of depth. Thermal cycling and electromigration stresses are performed on dedicated devices. Thermal cycling is revealed to induce only defects on non-mature processes. Electromigration induces voids in adjacent metal level, right at TSV interface. Moreover, the expected lifetime benefit by increasing line thickness does not occur due to increasing dispersion of voiding mechanism. Second part covers reliability of Cu TSV-middle technology, of 10 $\mu$m diameter and 80 $\mu$m depth, with thermal cycling, BEoL dielectric breakdown, and electromigration study. Thermal cycling is assessed on two designs: isolated and dense TSV patterns. Dielectric breakdown tests underline an impact of TSV on the reliability of metal level dielectrics right above TSV. Electromigration reveal similar degradation mechanism and kinetic as on TSV-last approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the array of copper (Cu) lines and the surrounding silicon (Si), upon temperature variation, affects the overall thermal expansion behavior of the whole TSV structure itself and generates an internal stress state. In this work we use the finite element method to numerically study the effective in-plane CTE of the Si/Cu composite structure. A 3D unit-cell approach is undertaken, which takes into account uniformly distributed TSVs in the Si chip. Results of the temperature-dependent effective CTE can be used as model input for simulating larger-scale 3D packages where the Si/Cu TSV structure is treated as a homogeneous material. We also examine the evolution of stress and deformation fields, and identify potential reliability concerns associated with the thermal loading. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our major contribution is the Balanced Skew Theorem, which provides a theoretical background to efficiently construct a buffered 3D clock tree that minimizes and balances the skew values under two distinct non-uniform thermal profiles. Our clock tree synthesis algorithm named BURITO (buffered clock tree with thermal optimization) first constructs a 3D abstract tree under the wirelength vs via-congestion tradeoff. This abstract tree is then embedded, buffered, and refined under the given non-uniform thermal profiles so that the temperature-dependent skews are minimized and balanced. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly reduce and perfectly balance clock skew values with minimal wirelength overhead.},

abstract = {Continual scaling of on-chip wiring structures has brought significant challenges for materials and processes beyond the 32-nm technology node in microelectronics. Recently, 3-D integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) has emerged as an effective solution to meet the future interconnect requirement. Among others, thermomechanical reliability is a key concern for the development of TSV structures used in die stacking as 3-D interconnects. This paper examines the effects of thermally induced stresses on the interfacial reliability of TSV structures. First, 3-D distribution of the thermal stress near the TSV and the wafer surface is analyzed. Using a linear superposition method, a semianalytic solution is developed for a simplified structure consisting of a single TSV embedded in a silicon (Si) wafer. The solution is verified for relatively thick wafers by comparing to numerical results from finite element analysis (FEA). The stress analysis suggests interfacial delamination as a potential failure mechanism for the TSV structure. An analytical solution is then obtained for the steady-state energy release rate as the upper bound for the interfacial fracture driving force, while the effect of crack length is evaluated numerically by FEA. With these results, the effects of the TSV dimensions (e.g., via diameter and wafer thickness) on the interfacial reliability are elucidated. Furthermore, the effects of via material properties and dielectric buffer layers are discussed.},

abstract = {3D IC technologies can help to improve circuit performance and lower power consumption by reducing wirelength. Also, 3D IC technology can be used to realize heterogeneous system-on-chip design, by integrating different modules together with less interference with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel thermal-aware 3D cell placement approach, named T3Place, based on transforming a 2D placement with good wirelength to a 3D placement, with the objectives of half-perimeter wirelength, through-the-silicon (TS) via number and temperature. T3Place is composed of two steps, transformation from a 2D placement to a 3D placement and the refinement of the resulting 3D placement. We proposed and compared several different transformation techniques, including local stacking transformation (LST), folding-2, folding-4 and window-based stacking/folding transformation, and concluded that (i) LST can generate 3D placements with the least wirelength, (ii) the folding-based transformations result in 3D placements with the fewest TS vias, and (iii) the window-based stacking/folding transformations provide good TS via number and wirelength tradeoffs. For example, with four device layers, LST can reduce the wirelength by over 2times compared to the initial 2D placement, while window-based stacking/folding can provide over 10times variation in terms of the TS via number, thus adaptive to different manufacturing ability for TS via density. Moreover, we proposed a novel relaxed conflict-net (RCN) graph-based layer assignment method to further refine the 3D placements. Compared to LST results, thermal-aware RCN graph-based layer assignment algorithm (r = 10{\%}) can further reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 37{\%}, with only 6{\%} TS via number increase and 8{\%} wirelength increase.},

In this paper, we perform a design space analysis study on 3-D CPUs. We show that aggressive cooling solutions such as MF cooling are necessary to unlock the true potential of 3-D ICs. Without such cooling the thermal feasibility region of the design space is significantly reduced. We observe that interactions between thermal, electrical, and physical aspects of 3-D CPUs with MF cooling are substantial, and must be cooptimized during our analysis to correctly identify optimal design points. We simulate a spectrum of 3-D CPU architectures which offer vast improvements to performance, but are energy inefficient and thermally infeasible with air cooling.

abstract = {Power delivery to the tier farthest away from the package in 3D VLSI is challenging. This is because the current provided by the package on the bottom is (1) first used by other tiers before it reaches the top, and (2) delivered using extremely small-size intra and inter-tier vias. Our solution is a tier partitioning method that assigns power hungry cells to the tier closer to the package, which is farther away from the heat spreader. Our study shows that this approach alleviates the IR-drop, power delivery network (PDN) resource usage, and power consumption in the top tier. Moreover, moving the cells to the bottom tier, unlike popular belief, does not cause any serious thermal issues. This is especially true in mobile applications, where heat is dissipated by both the heat spreader and printed circuit board. In summary, our tier-partitioning leads to 24.66{\%} IR-drop reduction, 28.57{\%} PDN resource reduction, and 4{\%} wirelength reduction, with {\textless}; 1°C increase in temperature.},

Predictions are based on thermal models solving one-dimensional conservation equations for boiling convection along microchannels, and are consistent with past data obtained from straight channels. The model is combined within a thermal resistance network to predict temperature distributions in logic and memory. The calculations indicate that a layer of integrated microchannel cooling can remove heat densities up to 135 W/cm2 within a 3D architecture with a maximum circuit temperature of 85°C.

abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers have investigated a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduce the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, partition the smaller graph, and then uncoarsen it to construct a partition for the original graph. From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not known if they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

The isoefficiency function (and thus scalability behaviour) of our algorithm is shown to be of a similar order as that for Kumar and Karypis' parallel multilevel graph partitioning algorithm. This good theoretical scalability is backed up by empirical results on hypergraphs taken from the VLSI and performance modelling application domains. Further, partition quality in terms of the k-1 metric is shown to be competitive with the best serial hypergraph partitioners and degrades only minimally as more processors are used.},

@article{Yeap2013,
abstract = {The explosive growth of smart mobile wireless devices in recent years has fundamentally transformed the semiconductor industry. Mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) has become the leading product driver for technology definition and manufacturing for the semiconductor industry. This trend was first observed in 28 nm and will continue for 20 nm, 16/14 nm, and 10 nm adoption and production ramp. Recent mobile SoC performance increase was achieved mainly through silicon technology scaling, and from single to dual- and quad-core. For mobile SoCs to continue offering new and exciting user-experiences, and longer battery life, a holistic approach in orthogonal system scaling to break out of the box of (speed*density/power/cost) constrains is mandated. Examples in the new paradigm of mobile heterogeneous computing are: energy-efficient transistors/memories/interconnects in expanding and boosting existing SoC functionalities (e.g., SiGe/III-V FinFET, GAA-FET, TFET, and RRAM/MRAM etc.), all-inclusive technology/design co-optimization to extract more values from silicon tech, RFFE system integration, and the multi-die integration by system partitioning that allows each component to be optimized and integrated closely together for lower cost and power, higher performance, and reduced form factor. Numerous challenges are ahead yet tremendous opportunities exist for collaborative and multiplicative innovations in the industry to enable the continued growth of mobile SoCs.},

@phdthesis{Wittmann2007,
abstract = {The MOS transistor performance depends on both the channel length and the carrier transport properties of the channel material. Novel materials with higher carrier mobilities beyond the achievable limits of process-induced strained silicon are required to facilitate continued commensurate device scaling. Nitrogen is incorporated into ultra-thin gate oxides to eliminate parasitic effects. In this thesis, doping profiles in high-mobility materials are investigated and the NBTI reliability is analyzed for a CMOS technology with nitrided gate oxide. Ion implantation will continue to be the primary technology for introducing dopant atoms into semiconductor wafers to form devices and integrated circuits (ICs). The reason for this lies in the flexibility of this doping technique in selection of dopant species, spatial location within the device, and in the accuracy of the number of implanted dopant atoms. The continued reduction in junction depths and lateral dimensions of the MOS transistor has directly resulted in growth of ion implantation applications in CMOS process technology, e.g. halo doping profiles have become necessary to suppress the short-channel effect. The physical ion implantation process can be effectively modeled on computers. Accurate simulation capabilities allow to optimize the doping profiles and to reduce the development time for a new CMOS technology. The investigation of doping profiles for advanced CMOS applications has been carried out with a Monte Carlo ion implantation simulator, developed in the scope of several PhD theses. The three-dimensional simulator MCIMPL-II is based on the physical BCA approach and uses the universal ZBL potential. An empirical model is used for the electronic stopping of ions and the generated point defects are calculated by a modified Kinchin-Pease model. As part of this work, the simulator has been improved and extended from crystalline silicon to advanced target materials on the basis of experimental results. Boron and arsenic were implanted into biaxially strained silicon, SiGe layers of different composition, and germanium within the energy range from about 1keV to 60keV. The successful calibration of the simulator for these materials is demonstrated by comparison of predicted doping profiles with SIMS measurements. The Monte Carlo simulation of ion trajectories is useful to analyze the impact of material properties and physical effects like damage accumulation and channeling on the profiles. The main results of the investigation are a shift to shallower profiles with increasing Ge content in SiGe alloys, the produced point defects are significantly reduced in germanium compared to silicon, and the stress-induced volume dilation in strained silicon has almost no influence on the profiles. As transistors get smaller in each successive CMOS generation, ensuring their reliability becomes increasingly difficult. The negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) effect in p-MOSFETs based on nitrided gate oxides has emerged as the dominant degradation mechanism for advanced CMOS technologies. As another part of this work, an experimental and simulation study for NBTI induced device parameter degradation was performed for a 90nm technology. Finally, the improved Monte Carlo ion implantation simulator is applied for the calculation of dopant distributions in topological complex three-dimensional structures, composed of strained or relaxed enhanced mobility materials. The selected examples demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation tool to facilitate the processing of advanced devices. Furthermore, the impact of storing random bit sequences on the NBTI lifetime of an SRAM cell is analyzed by numerical simulations. All presented applications were requested or inspired by industry.},
